                <p>Hello, I’m Mikaela Porazzo and I am a User Experience Designer. I’m passionate about designing products that delight users. I started my career as a Customer Success Manager which allowed me to work closely with software users and deeply understand their pain points and goals. 
                    From this experience, I was inspired to become a designer so that I could take a more active role in creating user-centric products. 
                    </p>
